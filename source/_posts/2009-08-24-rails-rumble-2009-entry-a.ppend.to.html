 Over the weekend, I had the privilege of competing with <a href="http://r09.railsrumble.com/teams/scatapult" target="_blank">Scatapult</a> in this year's Rails Rumble. I had an absolute blast working with <a href="http://twitter.com/reagent">Pat</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/tpitale">Tony</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/averyvery">Doug</a> this time around and
it goes without saying that everyone was on their game.
